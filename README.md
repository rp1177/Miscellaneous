# Miscellaneous
Other side projects that I experiment with and make to solve everyday problems.


### 1.) Notifications Discord Bot
I coded a Discord bot to help read, delete, and organize my Gmail inbox more efficiently by allowing the bot to communicate with Gmail API using Python. Future developments include more commands to help organize my emails further and to include notifications on data breaches.
